# Capacity Management System - Implementation Summary

## 📋 Overview

The Capacity Management System allows Sales Leads to track and manage team member workload, plan weekly tasks, and optimize resource allocation. The system implements an 8-item weekly capacity limit (tasks + calls) that is configurable per team member.
