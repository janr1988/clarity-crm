## üìÅ Implementation Files

### 1. Authorization Helper (`src/lib/authorization.ts`)

Core authorization functions:
- `isSalesLead(session)` - Check if user is Sales Lead
- `isSalesAgent(session)` - Check if user is Sales Agent
- `canViewUserDetails(session, userId)` - Check user detail access
- `canViewUserList(session)` - Check user list access
- `canViewAIInsights(session)` - Check AI insights access
- `canViewTeamPerformance(session)` - Check team KPI access

### 2. Protected API Routes

#### `/api/users` (GET, POST)
- **GET**: Only Sales Lead can view all users (403 for Sales Agent)
- **POST**: Only Sales Lead can create users (403 for Sales Agent)

- **PATCH**: Sales Lead can update any user, Sales Agent only their own profile
- **DELETE**: Only Sales Lead can delete users

#### `/api/ai/insights` (GET)
- **GET**: Only Sales Lead can access (403 for Sales Agent)

### 3. Protected Frontend Pages

#### `/insights` (AI Insights)
- Sales Lead: Full access to AI insights

## üß™ Testing the Authorization System

### Test Credentials

**Sales Lead:**
```
Email: lead@clarity.com
Password: lead123
```

**Sales Agent:**
```
Email: john@clarity.com
Password: agent123
```

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Sales Lead Tests

‚úÖ **Should Work:**
```bash
# Login as Sales Lead
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"lead@clarity.com","password":"lead123"}'

# View all users
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users

# Access AI Insights
curl http://localhost:3000/api/ai/insights

# View any user profile
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users/[any-user-id]
```

#### 2. Sales Agent Tests

‚úÖ **Should Work:**
```bash
# Login as Sales Agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"john@clarity.com","password":"agent123"}'

# View own profile
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users/[own-id]

# View customers
curl http://localhost:3000/api/customers
```

‚ùå **Should Fail (403 Forbidden):**
```bash
# Try to view all users
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users
# Expected: {"error":"Forbidden: Only Sales Leads can view all users"}

# Try to access AI Insights
curl http://localhost:3000/api/ai/insights
# Expected: {"error":"Forbidden: Only Sales Leads can access AI insights"}

# Try to view another user's profile
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users/[other-user-id]
# Expected: {"error":"Forbidden: You can only view your own profile"}
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Server-Side Protection
‚úÖ All authorization checks happen on the server
‚úÖ API routes validate session and permissions
‚úÖ Frontend redirects are backed by server-side checks

### 2. Defense in Depth
‚úÖ Authorization at API level (primary)
‚úÖ Authorization at page level (secondary)
‚úÖ UI elements hidden based on role (UX)

### 3. Session Management
‚úÖ NextAuth.js handles secure sessions
‚úÖ JWT tokens with role information
‚úÖ Automatic session refresh

## üìä Authorization Flow

```
User Request
    ‚Üì
Middleware (Authentication)
    ‚Üì
API Route / Page Component
    ‚Üì
getServerSession() ‚Üí Get user session
    ‚Üì
Authorization Helper (e.g., canViewUserList)
    ‚Üì
Check user role and permissions
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ Authorized ‚Üí Proceed
    ‚îî‚îÄ Not Authorized ‚Üí 403 Forbidden / Redirect
```

---

## üöÄ Adding New Protected Features

### Step 1: Add Authorization Helper

```typescript
// src/lib/authorization.ts
export function canManageCustomers(session: Session | null): boolean {
  return isSalesLead(session) || isSalesAgent(session);
}
```

### Step 2: Protect API Route

```typescript
// src/app/api/customers/route.ts
import { canManageCustomers } from "@/lib/authorization";

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
  
  if (!canManageCustomers(session)) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Forbidden" },
      { status: 403 }
    );
  }
  
  // ... rest of the logic
}
```

### Step 3: Protect Frontend Page

```typescript
// src/app/customers/new/page.tsx
import { canManageCustomers } from "@/lib/authorization";

export default async function NewCustomerPage() {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
  
  if (!canManageCustomers(session)) {
    redirect("/");
  }
  
  // ... rest of the component
}
```
