# 🚀 GitHub Integration Guide

Your Clarity CRM is ready to be pushed to GitHub! Follow these simple steps:

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All files staged and committed (46 files, 11,229 lines)
- ✅ `.gitignore` configured properly
- ✅ `.env.example` included (`.env` is ignored for security)
- ✅ Comprehensive commit message added

## 📋 Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

### Option A: Using GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name:** `clarity-crm` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description:** "A clean, functional CRM MVP built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma"
   - **Visibility:** Choose Public or Private
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT** choose a license yet (you can add it later)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Option B: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
# Make sure you're in the Clarity directory
cd /Users/janruske/Clarity

# Create the repository
gh repo create clarity-crm --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## 📤 Step 2: Push to GitHub (If using Website method)

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with commands. Use these:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the Clarity directory
cd /Users/janruske/Clarity

# Add GitHub as the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clarity-crm.git

# Rename main branch (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Alternative: Using SSH

If you have SSH keys set up with GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/clarity-crm.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Step 3: Environment Variables (Important!)

Your `.env` file is **not** pushed to GitHub (for security). Anyone cloning your repo needs to:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. The default SQLite configuration will work locally. For production, update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`

## 📝 Step 4: Update Repository Settings (Optional)

After pushing, you can enhance your repository:

### Add Topics/Tags
Go to your repository → Click the ⚙️ gear icon next to "About" → Add topics:
- `crm`
- `nextjs`
- `typescript`
- `tailwindcss`
- `prisma`
- `sqlite`
- `sales-management`
- `mvp`

### Add a License
- Go to "Add file" → "Create new file"
- Name it `LICENSE`
- Click "Choose a license template"
- Select MIT or your preferred license

### Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)
If you want to deploy the documentation:
- Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → Select `main` branch

## 🚀 Step 5: Deploy to Vercel (Optional)

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Add New" → "Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - Framework Preset: **Next.js**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
5. Add Environment Variable:
   - Key: `DATABASE_URL`
   - Value: Your PostgreSQL/Neon connection string
6. Click "Deploy"
