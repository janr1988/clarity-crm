✓ Close deal as lost with reason
✓ Display deals in list with correct data
```

### Flow #4: Task Reassignment (3 tests)
```typescript

✓ Maintain task data during reassignment
```

### Flow #5: Data Integrity (5 tests)

## 🛡️ Dummy Data Protection Features

### Automatic Backup/Restore
Every test automatically:
1. **Backs up** database before running
2. **Runs** the test
3. **Restores** database after completion

### Protection Mechanisms
- ✅ Sequential test execution (no parallel conflicts)
- ✅ Automatic database snapshots
- ✅ Rollback on test completion
- ✅ Unique test data generation
- ✅ Before/after state verification

---

## 🚀 Available Commands

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Interactive UI mode (recommended for development)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Debug mode with step-through
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Run with visible browser
npm run test:e2e:headed

# View last test report
npm run test:e2e:report

# Run ALL tests (unit + E2E)
npm run test:all
```

## 📊 What Gets Tested

### Data Integrity
- ✅ No duplicate records created
- ✅ No orphaned foreign key references
- ✅ Cascade deletes work correctly
- ✅ Data consistency across operations

### Forms & Validation
- ✅ All forms submit correctly
- ✅ Validation errors are caught
- ✅ Required fields are enforced
- ✅ Error messages display properly

### User Flows
- ✅ Login/authentication works
- ✅ Task creation and editing
- ✅ Customer management
- ✅ Deal lifecycle
- ✅ Task reassignment

### API Endpoints
- ✅ `/api/tasks` - CRUD operations
- ✅ `/api/customers` - CRUD operations
- ✅ `/api/deals` - CRUD operations
- ✅ All return correct status codes
- ✅ All return proper data structures

## 🎨 Key Features

### 1. Pre-Authenticated Fixtures
```typescript
test('my test', async ({ authenticatedPage }) => {
  // Already logged in as sales agent
});

test('my test', async ({ salesLeadPage }) => {
  // Already logged in as sales lead
});
```

### 2. Test Data Generation
```typescript
const { unique } = generateTestData();
const name = `Test Task ${unique}`; // Always unique
```

### 3. API Response Waiting
```typescript
const response = await waitForApiResponse(page, '/api/tasks');
expect(response.status()).toBe(201);
```

### 4. Database Helpers
```typescript
await dbHelpers.backup();   // Manual backup
await dbHelpers.restore();  // Manual restore
await dbHelpers.cleanup();  // Remove backup file
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Running Tests

1. **Update test credentials** in `e2e/fixtures.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const TEST_USERS = {
     salesLead: {
       email: 'lead@clarity.com',
       password: 'password123',
       id: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_USER_ID',  // ← Update this!
     },
   };
   ```

2. **Ensure dev server is running** or tests will start it automatically

3. **Check your seed data** matches the test expectations

### Test Execution

- Tests run **sequentially** (not in parallel)
- Each test takes **~5-15 seconds**
- Total suite runs in **~2-3 minutes**
- Database is backed up/restored automatically

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Browser not found"
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

### "Test timeout"
Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts`:
```typescript
timeout: 90000,  // 90 seconds
```

### "Cannot find element"
Tests use flexible selectors that work with most UI variations. If elements change significantly, update selectors in test files.

### "Database corruption"
If tests fail to restore:
```bash
npm run db:restore:latest
```
